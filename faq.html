<h3>What is UF CRYPTO?</h3><ul>

<p>	UF CRYPTO is a cryptography and high performance computing 
interest group composed of Faculty, Students and Staff at the University
of Florida.  It was formed in September of 1997 by V. Alex Brennen,
originally to work on the RC564 distributed.net effort.  Since that time
UF Crypto has expanded it's computing resources significantly and is 
currently seeking additional projects to apply this processing power to
after the completion of the RC564 project. Particularly, projects local to
the University of Florida.</p></ul>


<br><h3>What is the purpose of UF Crypto?</h3><ul>

<p>UF Crypto is currently concentrating on mobilizing the resources of
University of Florida students, faculty and staff in cryptography
related distributed computing efforts.</p></ul>

<br><h3>How powerful is UF Crypto?</h3><ul>

<p>	UF Crypto's processing power is currently equivalent to about 116
Pentium 200's.</p></ul>

<br><h3>What do I have to do to join UF Crypto?</h3><ul>

<p>	Join the UF Crypto team working on the RC564 project.  If you're
not interested in working on the RC564 project, and would still like to
be a member contact <a href="mailto:alexb@ufl.edu">Alex</a>.</p></ul>

<br><h3>	What is the RC564 project? And Why is UF Crypto interested
in
it?</h3><ul>

<p>	The RC564 project is an attempt to break a 64bit encryption
algorithm though brute force.  The algorithm the project is working
on is RSA's RC5 hash algorithm.  The RSA corporation has sponsored a
series of contests with $10,000 prizes to anyone capable of breaking 
different security levels of it's RC564 algorithms.  The goal of RSA
in sponsoring these competitions is to prove to the US Government,
which currently regulates the export of encryption under Arms and 
Munitions laws, that the current limit on the size of exportable 
cryptosystems is inappropriate and insecure.</p>

<p>	The level of security allowed in exportable cryptosystems
has a significant impact on US Corporations doing business overseas.
It also greatly effects Internet Commerce and other technologies that
require security and user confidence.  For example, the current limit on
Cryptosystem export will not allow 128bit copies of Netscape Communicator
to be exported.</p>

<p>By motivating groups, such as distributed.net, to demonstrate that
64bit encryption can be compromised by individuals utilizing the idle
processing time of internet connected systems, RSA hopes to influence 
US Policy.  They hope to convince policy makers that a more organized and
coordinated group such as a foreign government or foreign company could
easily break 64bit codes in less time and there by gain access to the
trade secretes of US Corporations.</p></ul>


<br><h3>Why should I work with UF Crypto on the RC5-64 Effort?</h3><ul>
<ul>	Because it's technically interesting.
	<br>Because you believe in an individual's right to privacy.
	<br>Because it will influence US Policy.
        <br>Because you could win $1,000 if you find the key.
	<br>Because it puts your computer to good use.
	<br>Because it makes UF look good.
	<br>Because it shows what incredible computing resources UF has.
	<br>Because it shows the power the internet has to enable 
collaboration.
	<br>Because it will raise awareness of Cryptography.
</ul>

<p>	Take your pick.  There's as many reasons to join the project as 
there are keys to crack.</p></ul>

<p>	If you've followed these steps, congratulations, you're now a
member of UF Crypto.  No more work is required of you,  your client
will take care of the rest.</p></ul>


<br><h3>I tried to join the team but the stats say that they're
down.</h3><ul>

<p>The stats go off line temporarily to update.  Try again in an hour or
so.</p></ul>


<br><h3>What else can I work on?</h3><ul>
<p>	Additional projects UF Crypto is currently working on include
the Internet Prime Number Search, and the Golumb Ruler search.</p></ul>

<br><h3>What resources does UF Crypto Provide?</h3><ul>

<p>We have a mailing list and a personal proxy available.</p></ul>


<br><h3>How do I subscribe to the mailing list?  How much traffic does it
get?</h3><ul>

<p>The mailing list typically gets a few messages a week.  To subscribe
send a message to <a
href="mailto:listserv@lists.ufl.edu">listserv@lists.ufl.edu</a> with no
subject and the following in the body of the message:
<ul><i>subscribe ufcrypto-l</i></ul>
<br>
You'll get a confirmation message that you'll need to return.</p></ul>
